## Features
This app features a bar chart display with currently 1 sorting algorithm working. On the click of a button the visualization will start.

## Future plans
The future plan is to add speed variability, so users can either speed up or slow down the speed at which the sorting is done.

### Note
This app is best viewed on a desktop computer (for browser, preferably chrome) as a mobile device makes is difficult on the eyes to view the visualization.

### Changelogs
Version 1.0
- Currently implemented bubble sort
- Implemented App color scheme
-Version 1.1 (Currently in development)
- Add speed variability
- Add number of bars present
- Add Insertion Sort visualization
